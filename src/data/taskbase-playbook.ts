export const TASKBASE_PLAYBOOK = `# **1\. Introduction & Purpose**

## **1.1. What This Playbook Covers :)**

This playbook outlines Taskbase’s end-to-end revenue motions—from market targeting and messaging to process, tools, and handoffs. It provides the “what good looks like” across roles and stages so every rep can execute confidently and consistently.

* Strategy: ICP, personas, value proposition, and competitive positioning  
* Execution: outreach templates, discovery flows, demos, proposals, and negotiations  
* Process: sales stages, MEDDICC/BANT-based qualification, exit criteria, and forecasting discipline  
* Collaboration: handoffs (MQL→SQL, SDR→AE, AE→CS), ABM with Marketing, and product feedback loops  
* Enablement: tools, dashboards, coaching, metrics, and continuous improvement

## **1.2. Who Should Use This Guide**

* AI Coach: We deploy an AI Coach who teaches all sales functions in their job how to do their job better. The AI Coach will take all the information from that guide. This guide needs to be adjusted to GenAI readability  
* SDRs: Pipeline creation, prospecting, meeting setting, qualification support  
* AEs: Discovery, solution mapping, ROI, deal strategy, multi-threading, closing  
* AMs: Adoption, value realization, renewals, expansion, executive alignment

## **1.3. How to Apply It in Your Daily Workflow**

* Start your day with intent: review your priority accounts, top 10 targets, and next best actions per stage.  
* Use the stage checklists and exit criteria to progress deals deliberately—don’t skip discovery validation or mutual action plans.  
* Personalize messaging from persona pain points and industry use cases. Log all activities to maintain CRM hygiene.

# **3\. Product Overview & Value Proposition**

## **3.1. Core Concept of Taskbase**

### **3.1.1 What Taskbase Is**

* **Taskbase is an AI coaching and learning platform for sales teams.**  
* **It learns directly from real sales interactions, not from hypothetical inputs.**  
* **It builds a dynamic skill profile for each rep based on observed behavior.**

### **3.1.2 How Taskbase Learns**

* **Input sources: cold calls, emails, CRM updates, Slack/Teams/Google Chat interactions with the AI coach.**  
* **Taskbase continuously analyzes these interactions to identify skills and gaps.**  
* **The skill profile evolves as reps improve or change behavior.**

### **3.1.3 Skill Profile Components**

**Taskbase evaluates skills across areas such as:**

* **Cold calling**  
* **Cold messaging**  
* **Discovery**  
* **Demo execution**  
* **Objection handling**  
* **Deal urgency**  
* **Follow-up and qualification**  
* **General communication effectiveness**

# **3.2. Proactive Coaching**

### **3.2.1 How Proactive Coaching Works**

* **After a rep completes a sales action (e.g., a cold call), Taskbase checks the interaction against the sales playbook.**  
* **The AI proactively messages reps in Slack, Teams, or Google Chat.**  
* **Example trigger message: “I listened to your opener—want feedback?”**

### **3.2.2 Adaptive Feedback**

* **Feedback adjusts to the rep’s current skill level.**  
* **If a rep implements changes, Taskbase registers this behavior as learning.**  
* **This creates a constant loop: action → feedback → improvement → profile update.**

# **3.3. Reactive Selling Support (Knowledge Retrieval)**

### **3.3.1 How Reps Use Taskbase on Demand**

**Examples of questions reps can ask taskbase:**

* **“Who fits our ICP?”**  
* **“Which customer is a relevant reference for a fintech prospect?”**  
* **“What’s the recommended objection response for pricing pushback?”**

### **3.3.2 Retrieval Source**

* **Answers are grounded in the company’s sales playbook and product knowledge.**  
* **The same engine that coaches reps also retrieves operational guidance.**

# **3.4. Content Maintenance & Data Requirements**

# **5\. Qualification Framework**

## **5.1. Overview of Qualification Methods used**

Primary: MEDDICC for enterprise/mid-market; BANT for high-velocity SMB; SPICED-style discovery for problem depth. Choose depth by ACV and complexity.

## **5.2. Discovery Question Library**

* Impact: What happens if this problem persists another two quarters?  
* Process: How do stage changes, approvals, and forecasting work today?  
* Metrics: Which KPIs define success for you and your leadership?

## **5.3. How to Score and Disqualify Opportunities**

Use a lead/deal score blending ICP fit, intent, pain severity, stakeholder access, and timing. Disqualify respectfully when lack of fit, authority, or compelling event is evident; leave the door open for nurture.

## **5.4. Qualification Tools and Templates**

In deal reviews, we use a specific framework so that we can focus on what really matters in every deal. The goal of deal reviews:

* Mitigate the risks we identify by talking through them  
* Discover questions we still need to ask our buyer so that we can better evaluate the deal

Here are categories (5Ps) and the respective questions you want to have an answer for before going into a deal review meeting:

### **5Ps Framework for Deal Reviews:**

The 5Ps Framework to use for Deal Reviews760Pain

* Do they already have a concrete project with a concrete goal?  
* What is the (quantifiable) business pain we are solving for the customer?  
* What is the impact of that pain (if not solved)?  
* What are the criteria they want to work with a company?  
* Where is the information coming from?

Priority

* Metrics are large or small?  
* Can the project be tied to a business initiative?

Power

* Who has the authority to release the funds and who will sign the deal?  
* Who is the true economic buyer?  
* Do we know some or have connections to some people who are high in the organisation?  
* Where is the information coming from?

People

* Who is your champion? How do you know they are a champion?  
* Who are the lend of people we are working with on this deal? In what way is each involved? What does each care about?  
* Where is the information coming from?

Process

* What steps do they as a company need to make to get to a buying decision?  
* Is the close date of that opportunity set into stone and discussed with the prospect?  
* Do we have something in place (Compelling event, specific customer urgency, pilot expiration, or other) that will drive the timeline?  
* Have we asked the client if they’ve thought about an appropriate range of investments to solve their problem? How do they plan on funding this?  
* Do we understand the decision criteria for the people involved in the decision-making steps?  
* Are they looking into other competitors as well?  
* Where is the information coming from?

## **5.5. Qualification for Expansion or Cross-Sell**

Intro

For many salespeople, a demo is treated as a one-time event in the sales process. The pattern is familiar: run a discovery call, gather some information, then schedule a demo meeting to present the product. This approach has worked in the past — but today’s world looks very different. Buyers are busier, better informed, and have higher expectations.

In lower-cost deals (say, below $10,000 a year), many buyers can self-educate and purchase without ever needing a demo. They’ll happily watch a pre-recorded product tour or click through an online sandbox. But once deal sizes climb, **personalized demos remain essential.**

Trümpi’s Substack is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

And here’s the critical point: if you’re delivering the same generic demo over and over, your role as a salesperson adds little value. In that case, you might as well send a video link. The only advantage left would be the “human factor”—that someone booked time with you and stayed to watch live. But that’s a thin reason for your existence.

Great demos, in contrast, are **personalized, dynamic, and context-driven.** They connect directly to the buyer’s situation and pains. They don’t follow a rigid structure — they adapt. And most importantly, they aren’t confined to a single meeting slot on the calendar.

### **Demos as a Tool, Not Just a Meeting**

Too often, demos are seen only as a fixed stage in the process. But a demo is a **tool** — just like discovery questions, case studies, or proof of value. You can use a demo at any moment if it helps the conversation.

Imagine you’re ten minutes into a discovery call. The buyer describes a painful, time-consuming process. If you know your solution can cut that process in half, why wait until a later demo? Show them right then. Anchor it in their reality by asking:

* *Can you see yourself using this?*  
* *If you did, how much time would it save you exactly?*

Suddenly, you’ve moved from features to impact. You’ve built a business case live in the meeting — and you can close that “mini-demo” before pivoting to another use case.

This is how modern salespeople should think: not in terms of “demo meeting” versus “discovery meeting,” but in terms of **use cases, tools, and value delivery.**

### **Delivering Value Early**

This mindset becomes even more critical in outbound sales. Inbound prospects may happily go through a clean sequence of discovery first, demo second. But outbound prospects have less patience. They didn’t ask to talk to you. If you spend thirty minutes asking questions without showing anything of value, chances are you won’t earn a second meeting.

That’s why the best sellers learn to **deliver value quickly** — weaving in snippets of demo during the very first call, always tailored to what the buyer has just said.

### **Yes, There’s Still a Demo Meeting**

That said, most sales processes still contain a dedicated demo-heavy meeting. This article will cover how to structure and run those demos for maximum impact. But keep this perspective in the back of your mind:

* A demo is not confined to one meeting.  
* A demo is a flexible tool.  
* And the best demos don’t show “everything” — they show what matters most to the buyer.

With that foundation set, let’s dive deeper into how to design, deliver, and master sales demos.

Chapter 1: How to Structure a Demo

A demo is not about showing everything your product can do. It’s about showing the *right things* in the *right order* so that the buyer connects what they see with their real challenges and goals. Whether you’re running a full demo meeting or dropping a quick demo snippet into a discovery call, the structure is the same.

Think of the demo as a sequence of four steps:

* **Recap** – Align on what you’ve heard.  
* **Permission** – Set expectations for the flow.  
* **Show** – Present the most relevant feature first.  
* **Ask** – Confirm value and anchor it in their reality.

This framework ensures your demos are focused, conversational, and tied to business impact — not a product tour. Let’s break it down.

Step 1: Recap What You’ve Heard

The first thing you do in a demo is **recap what you understood from the buyer.**

* In a scheduled demo meeting, recap what came out of your discovery call.  
* In a quick on-the-spot demo, recap what they just told you in the conversation.

Don’t just say: *“Let me show you the product.”*  
Instead say:

“From our last call, I understood three main points. First, coaching reps takes a lot of time, and managers can’t scale it effectively. Second, reporting is slow and manual. And third, you’re missing insights into which deals are actually at risk. Does that sound right?”

Make it **visual.** Put a slide on screen that summarizes:

* **Use Case 1**  
* **Use Case 2**  
* **Use Case 3**  
* **Negative impact if not solved**

The last part — the negative impact — is crucial. What happens if they keep doing things the old way? What are the ripple effects if nothing changes? (Chris Orlob calls these “ripple effects.”) For example:

* “If coaching doesn’t scale, managers stay overloaded, and reps don’t change behavior.”  
* “If reporting remains manual, leadership decisions are always based on outdated data.”

Then **confirm with them:**

“Did I capture that correctly? Would you add or adjust anything?”

This is more than a check-in. Buyers nearly always correct or add details when you recap, which gives you richer information. And it shows them you’ve been listening — a huge trust builder.

💡 *Pro tip:* Recap is not just for demos. Use it everywhere — cold calls, discovery, even email follow-ups. Reformulating what you’ve heard is one of the fastest ways to create alignment and open the door to more information.

Step 2: Get Permission to Proceed

Once you’ve confirmed the recap, explain what’s coming next and ask for permission.

For example:

“Here’s what I’d like to do. I’ll walk you through how we handle \[challenge\], and then we can discuss whether that would work in your process. Does that sound okay?”

This small step makes the buyer feel in control. It also removes resistance because you’re not pushing a flow onto them — you’re inviting them to agree.

You’ve used this same technique before:

* In a cold call: *“Do you mind if I take 30 seconds to explain why I’m calling?”*  
* In discovery: *“Can I propose an agenda for today’s call?”*

The psychology is the same: **permission creates alignment.**

Step 3: Show the Best Feature First

Now it’s time to show your product. But here’s the rule: **show as little as possible, and start with the most important thing.**

* Don’t go in order: challenge 1, challenge 2, challenge 3\.  
* Start with the *hair-on-fire problem* that matters most to them. Or simply your most amazing feature (hopefully powered by AI).

For example: if they said coaching their reps is the hardest and most costly issue, don’t start with reporting — start with the coaching feature.

Sometimes you need to give context first (like where the feature lives in the platform). But keep that to **30 seconds max.** You want to land the killer feature first, and here is why:

* Attention is highest at the beginning. If you bury your best feature, you risk losing them before they see the real value.  
* Solving their top challenge first creates immediate urgency and relevance.

Remember: you’re not running a **tour.** You’re running a **business case in action.**

Step 4: Ask the Right Questions

Here’s where many reps go wrong. They show a feature, then immediately jump to the next one. Don’t do that. After every feature, you must **ask.**

There are two questions you should cycle through:

* **Do you see yourself using this?**

Simple, but powerful. Forces them to visualize themselves in the workflow.

* **Do you see value from this compared to how you do it today?**

Even better if you make it concrete:

“Compared to the way you’re doing this now, do you think this would make you more efficient?”  
“If you had this in place, how much time do you think your managers would save each week?”

These questions are not throwaways. They do three things:

* They force the buyer to process what they’ve seen.  
* They tie the feature back to *their* workflow.  
* They often surface numbers or impact statements you can use later in the business case.

Example talk track:

“You mentioned earlier that reporting takes your team about two days each month. If you had this workflow in place, do you think that time would shrink? By how much?”

Now you’re not just showing a feature — you’re co-building ROI with the buyer.

Bringing It Together

So, the structure of a great demo looks like this:

* **Recap** – Summarize their situation, challenges, and impacts. Confirm.  
* **Permission** – Lay out what’s next and ask if it’s okay.  
* **Show** – Deliver the most relevant feature first. Keep it tight.  
* **Ask** – Anchor the feature in their world. Confirm value and impact.

This structure works for both a full demo meeting and a quick five-minute demo snippet mid-discovery. It keeps the conversation tied to business outcomes instead of product features, and it ensures the buyer is engaged throughout — not just sitting back passively watching your screen.

Chapter 2: Running the Demo

I can’t teach you a one-size-fits-all demo for your product, because great demos are specific. They’re built on the pains, use cases, and opportunities we uncovered with the buyer. That’s the point: we demo *their world*, not *our product*. What I *can* teach is how to think about the moving parts so you can adapt in real time.

Don’t Script a Live Demo—Script the Use Cases

I recently watched a startup’s recorded demo. They had scripted the entire thing end-to-end. That’s advanced and not advanced at the same time. If a demo can be fully scripted and only works when you follow the script, you don’t need a rep to perform it live. Record it. Keep it under ten minutes. Host it on Loom, Vidyard—whatever. Send it *before* the meeting and use the live time to discuss what matters.

I’ve done exactly that for a new ICP. Our flow only worked if I clicked in a precise sequence. Rather than risk a live stumble, I recorded an eight-minute walkthrough and sent it ahead of the first call. It worked. If your “demo” is always the same, don’t perform it—*package* it.

What deserves scripting is different:

* **Challenge/Use Case \#1 → the smallest possible demo slice that proves you solve it.**  
* **Challenge/Use Case \#2 → the slice that proves you solve it.**  
* **Challenge/Use Case \#3 → same.**

That belongs in the playbook. Not a start-to-finish tour, just modular slices tied to problems.

Cut the Interface Tour

Too many reps log in and narrate the screen: “Top right are settings. Here’s the admin. This is the dashboard. Over here we set up tutors…” Boring. Useless. Buyers don’t need a museum guide; they need relief.

Show the *one* thing that relieves pressure **right now**. If context is absolutely required, keep it to thirty seconds, then land the punch.

Prepare Your Tabs Like a Pro

If discovery and demo are in separate meetings, prepare for speed:

* Open **one browser tab per use case**, each already positioned on the exact screen that proves value for that use case.  
* Start with the hair-on-fire problem. No warm-up lap.

This tiny bit of prep prevents rambling navigation and keeps the flow tight.

Whenever Possible, Demo a Real Environment

I’ve often had the luxury of showing live, real environments because we could provision them cheaply. If you can show the real thing, do it. Priority number one.

When that’s not possible—client-specific data, privacy concerns—clone a realistic environment. Anonymize what you must, but make it look and feel exactly like what they would use. If your tool requires special scaffolding to stage a believable scenario, invest the time once and duplicate it forever.

The Four-Step Flow Still Rules (Even Mid-Call)

Whether you’re in a full demo or dropping a mid-discovery snippet, the same flow applies:

* **Recap** what I understood (use cases \+ ripple effects if nothing changes), confirm it.  
* **Permission** to proceed: “Here’s what I’d like to do… does that sound okay?”  
* **Show** the most important feature first, as little as possible to prove the point.  
* **Ask** immediately after each feature:  
* “**Do you see yourself using this?**”  
* “**Compared to how you’ve been doing this before, do you think you’ll be more effective and efficient with the way I’ve shown you in this demo?**”  
* If I already know their workflow: “If you had this in place, how much time would your managers save each week?”

This turns features into impact. We co-author the business case in real time.

Chapter 3: Closing the Demo: Summarise, Score, Decide

At the end, I bring the conversation back to clarity and commitment.

I summarize in their words:

“Let me quickly summarize. We discussed challenge \#1, challenge \#2, and challenge \#3. For \#1, I asked if you see yourselves using this—you said definitely yes.”

Then I quantify *importance* with a clean scale:

“From **0 to 10**, given your challenge and what you saw today, how important is it for you to solve this **the way we showed**?”

I do this for each use case when there are multiple. If it’s messy or we only covered one, I still ask for an overall score.

Here’s my rule of thumb: **anything below 8, I pause.** I ask:

“Typically when clients are below eight, it isn’t worth pushing internally right now. **What would need to be true** for this to move to an eight or nine?”

Now I learn whether it’s missing features, timing, budget, strategy, or stakeholders. If there’s nothing I can influence, I *don’t chase*. I’ll suggest:

“Let’s revisit in six months when priorities may shift. Shall we schedule that follow-up now?”

If they score **8–10**, I tighten the loop:

“Great—what would bring this to a nine or ten?”

I capture the specifics; those become my next-step inputs.

Add Stakeholders the Right Way

In most demo calls, I ask the stakeholder question explicitly—this is the exact line:

**“Who else does want to be involved in a project like this somewhere on the way before it is signed, or before we decide that we’re actually going to work together for sure? Who else would be interested in being part of this journey?”**

They’ll give me names. I don’t leave them to carry the message internally. I propose the next step immediately:

“Perfect. Rather than you relaying everything—which is time-consuming and invites technical questions—you can’t be expected to answer—**let’s bring them in**. I’ll re-summarize the situation, the challenges, the impact, and show the specific slices we covered today. Does that work? When should we meet?”

Deal size dictates structure. For **\<10k**, I compress and often go for signature. Around **10–50k**, I still keep it lean but may add one stakeholder meeting. At **50–300k+**, I invest: multiple stakeholder demos, sometimes short intros first, never a single massive meeting with CFO \+ CEO \+ COO \+ CSO. If there are multiple departments, we go one by one.

### **When “My Boss Needs to See This” Appears**

If my champion says, “I need to ask my boss,” I steer toward a business case:

“Your boss probably cares about **\[KPI X\]**—is that right? Often leaders want three things:

* What we invest.  
* What we get back over time.  
* How this ties to a **strategic initiative**.

Let’s prepare that. I’ll assemble the numbers we discussed and map it to the initiative. **When should we do the ROI meeting?**”

For larger deals, once a few people are engaged, I may recommend a focused **workshop**—but only when there’s clear buy-in and agenda.

### **What I Leave Behind (or Use to Open the Next Call)**

I create a **single, tight slide** we can circulate internally and reuse to kick off the next meeting. It includes:

* **Situation / Use Cases** (their language)  
* **Impact / Ripple Effects** if nothing changes  
* **Solution Description** (only the slices we showed)  
* **How We’ll Measure Impact** (time saved, error rate reduced, pipeline hygiene—whatever they named)  
* **Specifics** that matter to them (data protection, where we start, rollout plan)  
* **Top 2–3 Objections \+ crisp answers**

This becomes the internal memo my champion wishes they had time to write. I write it for them.

### **Putting It All Together (Flow I Actually Use)**

* Recap (slide visible) → Confirm.  
* Permission to proceed → “Does that sound okay?”  
* Show slice \#1 (hair-on-fire) → Ask: “Do you see yourself using this?” \+ “Compared to today… more effective and efficient?” → quantify time/money.  
* Show slice \#2 → Ask again.  
* Show slice \#3 (if needed) → Ask again.  
* Summarize → Importance 0–10 per slice or overall.  
* If \<7 → clarify what would move it up; park with a date.  
* If 8–10 → add stakeholders with a concrete invite; or propose ROI meeting/workshop.  
* Send the one-slide recap/business case.

That’s the craft. I’m not proving that my product is big; I’m proving that their problem can be small—and soon.

| Cold Call Objections | Best Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Could you send the demo link because i get many calls and email about sales Tech? | I gladly share a demo with you. Now, if your sales reps will get that question with the email, what would you teach them? You would not allow them to get off and just send the email, right? My AI Tutor does not allow me to do that either. It asks whether we can book a meeting next week and in case you do not like the demo I send you, you can still cancel. Should we quickly look in our calendars next week? |
| We already have trainings in place. | That is great. Our AI Tutors teach the reps exactly what you already have in your trainings. What we realised with our clients is that only about 5-10% of reps actually consume those ressources and can keep their content over time and actually put them into practice. Is that something that sounds familiar for you as well? |
| Are you a training provider? | Are you looking for one? |
| We already have a training provider | That is fantastic, almost all our clients have and implemented such methodologies as Sandler, MEDDIC or SPICED or have done other trainings. One challenge we have seen with these is that reps learn them in an intense course but forget more than 90% of it again after 2-3 months. Is that something that sounds familiar? |
| Are you a sales enablement provider? | Are you looking for one? |
| We have enablement team in-house. | That is fantastic, almost all our clients have a sales enablement team in place that is responsible for training. Is that what your sales enablement team does as well on their own? |
| How do you measure how people change their behaviour? | We usually have two approaches. First, we choose specific skills that we want to develop in your sales reps. For instance uncovering urgency and let’s say cold call skills. Now, the tutor autonomously develops those skills in your reps during the day. After a short periode, let’s say 3 months, we can analyse the cold calls and see whether they have improved in quality. Another way is the tutor actually delivers points to the reps for getting those skills right. If the points have improved on their personal skill table, it is a good sign they actually have improved and the conversion rates, sales cycles and deal sizes will follow. Do you have specific skills you see in your reps that need continuous development? |
| We do not have the culture that supports learning | Yeah we have seen that in some other organisations as well. Does that mean you are not investing in learning at all? |
| We have it covered | \- You have it covered? \- Do you mean you have people who train your team? |
| I’m in a meeting | That must be a really boring meeting? (smile) |
| Send me an email | Sure, that is a great suggestion. Can I add something to that? Let’s book a meeting already in 1 or 2 weeks, I send you the material, and in case you do not like it, you can still cancel. This way, we safe each other’s time. When works for you? |
| Data privacy (Betriebsrat in Germany): we can’t get access to CRM data and evaluate individual performance. | Anonymized data → however, can this be used for coaching? |
| We are good right now |  |
| We have highly skilled reps that follow all of our trainings | Oh wow, I never heard that before. Are you interested in selling your methodology, could be a million dollar training idea (laugh a little) |
| That is right now not in our priority list | What needs to happen in order for that to change? Until when? |
| Are you another recording tool such as Gong, Kickscale, etc.? | Are you using a recording tool already? We do not record calls \- that already needs to be in place in order to work with us on some skills. The challenge with Gong is that nobody uses their coaching feature because no rep is proactively watching the overwhelming feedback of this coaching feature. So they never learn. Then explain what Taskbase does differently (proactively, skill development, data from CRM) |
| It won’t work in our environment? |  |

| Do you have any examples of sales playbooks like best you have somehow anonymized? |  |
| Five skills are included. And how many skills do you have? |  |
| Does this work for customer success as well? | Yes, of course. The skills are a bit different but we use it with our CS team too. |

**Understanding Data Privacy, Data Protection, and Works Council Requirements for Skill Profiles**

This article clarifies common misconceptions about why certain employee-related features—especially skill profiles—may or may not be displayed in a product. Discussions often reference “data privacy issues,” yet the underlying constraints usually lie elsewhere. The goal here is to distinguish between the relevant domains: **data protection**, **security**, **works council requirements**, and **legal considerations**, with a focus on the German regulatory context.

## **13.5.1. Data Protection: What It Actually Regulates**

Data protection authorities primarily assess **which types of data are being collected** and how they are processed. Different data types carry different levels of risk:

* **Low-risk data** (e.g., name, email address) typically triggers minimal scrutiny.  
* **Higher-risk data**, such as **skill profiles**, **audio recordings**, or **video data**, requires more attention regarding:

Storage location (e.g., country-specific restrictions)

* Data handling and retention  
* Subprocessors and third-party access

A key point:  
**Data protection rules rarely prohibit displaying a skill profile.**  
The assessment focuses on **storage, processing, and data flows**, not on whether the information can be shown in the interface.

## **13.5.2. Security Considerations**

Security requirements run in parallel with data protection. As data sensitivity increases, customers expect stronger guarantees around:

* Infrastructure and storage  
* Access control  
* Internal and external data transfers

Although important, these concerns do not directly affect whether a skill profile can be displayed.

## **13.5.3. Works Council (Betriebsrat): The Real Visibility Constraint**

In Germany, works councils play a decisive role when technology could be interpreted as **employee monitoring**. Under relevant labor laws, they have a right of co-determination for tools that:

* Collect behavioral data  
* Infer performance- or skill-related insights  
* Could create pressure on employees to behave in particular ways

Because skill profiles often rely on user interactions and behavioral signals, they may fall under this category. Typical works council concerns include:

* Displaying the profile might create **implicit performance pressure**.  
* Managers could theoretically use the data to evaluate individuals or tie compensation to AI-inferred metrics.  
* As a result, councils may require:

Limiting visibility

* Providing only a private view to the employee  
* Renaming or reframing the feature (e.g., “wallet”)  
* Adjusting how the data is generated or presented

In previous implementations with similar functionality, works councils have imposed restrictions even when data protection authorities had no objections.

## **13.5.4. Legal Topics and Customer Maturity**

Legal considerations vary by country, but in Germany they typically intersect with the works council’s rights. Many early-stage customers do not have a works council yet, meaning these constraints become relevant only as organizations grow.

## **Summary**

* **Data privacy** is not the reason skill profiles cannot be shown; its focus lies on data categories and processing.  
* **Works council requirements**, particularly regarding employee monitoring, are the primary factor influencing whether and how such profiles can be displayed.  
* Visibility limitations, naming adjustments, and display rules typically originate from **co-determination rights**, not from data protection law.
