# ICP & Problem Landscape

## Ideal Customer Profile

**Target companies:**
- B2B SaaS companies with 50–500 employees
- Annual revenue between $5M–$100M
- Have an established sales team (5+ reps)
- Selling a product with average deal size > $10K ARR
- Using at least a CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot) and basic sales tools

**Industries we win in:**
- Software & Technology
- Financial Services (FinTech)
- Professional Services
- Healthcare Technology

**Geographic focus:** North America, Western Europe

**Company signals that indicate fit:**
- Recently hired a VP of Sales or CRO
- Expanding their sales team (job postings for AEs/SDRs)
- Mentions of "sales enablement" or "revenue operations" in job postings
- Recently raised Series A–C funding

## ICP Fit Assessment & Red Flags

**Strong fit indicators:**
- Sales team actively uses a CRM with structured pipeline stages
- Leadership is data-driven and tracks sales metrics
- They have (or are building) a sales playbook in some form
- Pain around onboarding new reps or inconsistent messaging

**Red flags — proceed with caution:**
- No dedicated sales team (founder-led sales only)
- Deal size < $5K ARR (ROI is harder to justify)
- No CRM or pipeline process in place
- "We don't believe in playbooks" mindset from leadership
- Company is in cost-cutting mode with hiring freeze

**Disqualification criteria (walk away):**
- Fewer than 3 sales reps
- No budget authority identified after 2 meetings
- Product is pre-revenue or pre-PMF
- They want a free tool, not a paid solution

## Persona Challenges & Success Metrics

### VP of Sales / CRO
**Challenges:**
- New reps take 6+ months to ramp
- Inconsistent messaging across the team
- No visibility into what "good" looks like
- Playbook exists but nobody uses it

**Success metrics:**
- Reduce ramp time from 6 months to 3 months
- Increase win rate by 10–15%
- Standardize messaging across all reps

### Sales Enablement Manager
**Challenges:**
- Playbook content is scattered across tools (Google Docs, Notion, Confluence)
- Hard to keep content up to date
- No way to measure if reps are actually using the playbook
- Onboarding is ad-hoc and inconsistent

**Success metrics:**
- Single source of truth for all playbook content
- Measurable adoption and engagement
- Faster content updates and distribution

### Head of Revenue Operations
**Challenges:**
- Disconnected tools and processes
- No standardized methodology across teams
- Difficulty identifying skill gaps across the organization

**Success metrics:**
- Integrated workflow with existing CRM and tools
- Data-driven coaching recommendations
- Consistent process adherence

## Decision-Maker Roles & Buying Groups

**Typical buying committee:**

| Role | Involvement | What they care about |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| VP of Sales / CRO | Decision maker | Revenue impact, rep performance, scalability |
| Sales Enablement | Champion / Evaluator | Ease of use, content management, adoption |
| Rev Ops | Technical evaluator | Integrations, data, reporting |
| Finance / CFO | Budget approver | ROI, cost per rep, contract terms |
| Individual Rep | End user (sometimes consulted) | Ease of use, relevance of content |

**Key insight:** The champion is usually Sales Enablement, but the budget holder is VP of Sales or CRO. Always get both in the room by meeting 2.

## Use Cases & Proven Value

### Use Case 1: New Rep Onboarding
"A Series B SaaS company reduced new rep ramp time from 5.5 months to 2.5 months by giving every new hire a structured, interactive playbook on day one."

### Use Case 2: Messaging Consistency
"A 40-person sales team went from 15 different elevator pitches to one unified message framework. Their demo-to-close rate improved by 22%."

### Use Case 3: Playbook Modernization
"A VP of Sales had a 90-page PDF playbook that nobody read. After migrating to an interactive format, weekly playbook engagement went from 2% to 68% of the team."

### Use Case 4: Skill Gap Analysis
"A CRO discovered that 80% of their team couldn't handle pricing objections effectively. Targeted coaching on that single skill improved average deal size by 18%."

# Value Proposition & Messaging

## Core Value Proposition

**One-liner:** We help sales teams turn their playbook into a living tool that reps actually use — so every rep sells like your best rep.

**Elevator pitch (30 seconds):**
"Most sales teams have a playbook somewhere — a PDF, a Notion doc, a Confluence page. The problem is nobody reads it, it's always out of date, and there's no way to know if your team is actually following it. We turn that static document into an interactive, always-current guide that identifies skill gaps and helps reps improve where it matters most."

**Value pillars:**
1. **Living playbook** — Not a static document. Always current, always accessible.
2. **Skill gap visibility** — See exactly where each rep needs to improve.
3. **Faster ramp** — New reps get up to speed in weeks, not months.
4. **Consistent execution** — Every rep follows the same proven process.

## Persona-Specific Messaging

### For VP of Sales / CRO:
"You've invested in building a playbook, but how do you know your team is following it? We give you visibility into skill gaps across your team and help every rep execute like your top performer."

### For Sales Enablement:
"You're spending hours maintaining playbook content across scattered docs. We give you one place to manage everything, with built-in analytics so you can see what's working and what's not."

### For Rev Ops:
"We integrate with your existing stack and give you data on process adherence and skill coverage — so you can make coaching recommendations based on evidence, not gut feel."

## Pitch Scripts

### Cold call opener:
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Taskbase. I'm reaching out because I noticed you're scaling your sales team — congrats on the growth. Quick question: how are you onboarding new reps right now? Do they have a structured playbook to follow, or is it more ad-hoc?"

### Email sequence — first touch:
Subject: Your playbook is probably a PDF nobody reads

"Hi [Name],

I talk to sales leaders every week who tell me the same thing: they have a playbook, but their reps don't use it.

The usual reasons: it's out of date, it's buried in a doc somewhere, and there's no way to know if anyone's actually reading it.

We help teams like [similar company] turn their playbook into something reps open every day. Their ramp time dropped by 50%.

Worth a 15-minute chat?"

### LinkedIn message:
"Hi [Name] — saw you're growing the sales team at [Company]. Curious: how are you handling playbook and onboarding for new reps? We've helped similar teams cut ramp time in half. Happy to share how if you're interested."

## Objection Handling Foundations

**Framework: Acknowledge → Clarify → Respond → Redirect**

When handling objections, follow this pattern:
1. **Acknowledge** — Show you heard them. "That's a fair concern."
2. **Clarify** — Make sure you understand. "Can you tell me more about what's driving that?"
3. **Respond** — Address with evidence or reframe. Use customer stories when possible.
4. **Redirect** — Move the conversation forward. "Given that, would it make sense to..."

**Key principle:** Objections are buying signals. They mean the prospect is engaged enough to push back. Never get defensive.

## Product Capabilities & Customer Outcomes

| Capability | What it does | Customer outcome |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Playbook import | Brings in content from Notion, Confluence, PDF | No starting from scratch — use what you have |
| Skill mapping | Maps playbook sections to sales skills framework | See exactly what's covered and what's missing |
| Gap analysis | Identifies missing or weak playbook areas | Prioritize what to fix first |
| AI coaching | Suggests improvements for weak sections | Better content without hiring a consultant |
| Section editing | Edit and improve playbook content in-app | Keep the playbook current and relevant |
| Health score | Overall playbook quality metric | Track improvement over time |

---

# Sales Vocabulary & Buyer Language

## Internal Sales Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Health score | Percentage of skills covered in the customer's playbook |
| Skill gap | A sales skill that's missing or poorly covered in the playbook |
| Coverage | How well a playbook section addresses a specific skill |
| Section | A discrete topic area within the playbook |
| Ramp time | Time from new rep hire to full productivity |

## Buyer-Facing Terminology

Use language the buyer uses, not our internal jargon:

| We say internally | Say this to buyers |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Skill mapping | "We analyze your playbook to find gaps" |
| Health score | "Your playbook quality score" |
| Import pipeline | "We bring in your existing playbook content" |
| Section analysis | "We break down your playbook by topic" |

## Terms to Avoid & Correct Usage

**Avoid:**
- "AI-powered" (overused, triggers skepticism) → Say "smart analysis" or just describe what it does
- "Disruptive" → Say "different approach" or "better way"
- "Synergy" → Be specific about what integrates with what
- "Best-in-class" → Use specific metrics or customer quotes instead
- "Paradigm shift" → Just explain the change plainly

**Correct usage examples:**
- Don't say: "Our AI-powered platform disrupts sales enablement"
- Do say: "We analyze your playbook and show you exactly which skills your team needs to work on"

## Key Industry Terms

Know these terms — your buyers use them daily:

- **Sales enablement:** The process of providing reps with the tools, content, and training they need to sell effectively
- **Revenue operations (Rev Ops):** The function that aligns sales, marketing, and CS operations
- **MEDDIC/MEDDPICC:** Popular qualification frameworks (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Process, Decision Criteria, Identify Pain, Champion, Competition)
- **BANT:** Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline — classic qualification framework
- **ACV/ARR:** Annual Contract Value / Annual Recurring Revenue
- **Stage progression:** Movement of a deal through pipeline stages
- **Win rate:** Percentage of opportunities that close-won

## Correct Language Examples

**In a discovery call:**
- ✅ "What does your onboarding process look like for new reps today?"
- ❌ "Do you have a playbook?" (too direct, might get a defensive "yes" even if it's bad)

**When discussing value:**
- ✅ "Teams like yours typically see ramp time drop by 40-50%"
- ❌ "We guarantee faster ramp times" (never guarantee specific outcomes)

**When talking about competition:**
- ✅ "The approach we take is different because we start with what you already have"
- ❌ "Competitor X is terrible because they make you start from scratch"

---

# Qualification & Risk Assessment

## Qualification Methodology

We use a simplified MEDDIC approach adapted for our sales motion:

| Element | Question to answer | Minimum bar |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Metrics** | What measurable outcome do they want? | Can articulate at least one (ramp time, win rate, etc.) |
| **Economic Buyer** | Who signs the check? | Identified by name and title |
| **Decision Process** | How do they evaluate and buy? | Understand steps and timeline |
| **Decision Criteria** | What matters most to them? | Know their top 3 priorities |
| **Identified Pain** | What's broken today? | Can describe a specific, current problem |
| **Champion** | Who is selling internally for us? | Have an engaged internal advocate |

## ICP Fit in Qualification

Score each deal on ICP fit early (in discovery or first call):

**A-tier (pursue aggressively):**
- 50-500 employees, $10M+ revenue
- Established sales team with 10+ reps
- Active sales enablement function
- Budget confirmed or likely

**B-tier (pursue with conditions):**
- 20-50 employees or 500-1000 employees
- Sales team of 5-10 reps
- No dedicated enablement but VP Sales is engaged
- Budget TBD but interest is genuine

**C-tier (qualify harder before investing time):**
- <20 employees or >1000 (different motion needed)
- Very early sales team (<5 reps)
- No clear champion
- "Just exploring" with no timeline

## Risk Detection Guidance

**Watch for these during discovery and demo:**

- **"We need to check with..." (unnamed person)** → Decision process is unclear. Ask: "Can you walk me through who else would need to weigh in?"
- **Multiple reschedules** → Low priority or champion losing interest. Address directly.
- **"Can you just send a proposal?"** → They may be comparison shopping. Push for a meeting to present it live.
- **No access to economic buyer by meeting 3** → Deal may stall. Escalate with champion.
- **"We're also looking at [competitor]"** → Normal, but ask what criteria they're evaluating on.

## Deal Health Flags

**Green flags (healthy deal):**
- Champion actively engaged and responsive
- Multiple stakeholders involved
- Clear timeline and budget range discussed
- They're sharing internal context freely
- Next steps are always confirmed

**Yellow flags (needs attention):**
- Communication slowing down
- Rescheduled meetings
- Only one person engaged
- "We need more time" without specifics
- Asking for heavy discounts early

**Red flags (deal at risk):**
- Gone dark for 2+ weeks
- Champion left the company
- "We decided to build internally"
- No budget allocated and no plan to get it
- They won't introduce you to the economic buyer

## True Requirements vs Nice-to-Haves

During qualification, separate what they actually need from wish-list items:

**Ask:** "If you could only solve one problem with a tool like this, what would it be?"

**True requirements** (deal-breakers if missing):
- Must integrate with their CRM
- Must support their existing content (Notion/Confluence/PDF)
- Must be usable by reps without training
- Must have a way to measure adoption

**Nice-to-haves** (want but won't kill the deal):
- Custom branding
- Advanced analytics
- API access
- SSO (unless enterprise)

## Process Best Practices & Examples

**Always:**
- Send a recap email within 2 hours of every meeting
- Confirm next meeting before ending the current one
- Share something valuable (insight, benchmark, article) between meetings
- Keep your CRM updated same-day

**Example recap email:**
"Hi [Name], thanks for the great conversation today. Here's what I took away:
- Your main challenge is [X]
- You're looking for [Y] outcome
- Next step: [specific action and date]

Let me know if I missed anything. Looking forward to [next meeting]."

## Common Mistakes & What Good Looks Like

| Mistake | What good looks like |
|---------|---------------------|
| Demoing without discovery | Always do discovery first — even if they insist on "just a quick demo" |
| Talking to only one person | Get 2+ stakeholders involved by meeting 2 |
| Sending a proposal without presenting it | Always walk through the proposal live |
| Letting deals go dark | Follow up within 48 hours if you don't hear back |
| Discounting too early | Understand their budget first, then discuss pricing |
| Skipping the recap email | Send one after every single meeting |

---

# Discovery & Customer-Centric Questioning

## Company-Specific Discovery Questions

**Understanding their current state:**
- "Walk me through how a new rep gets up to speed today. What's the process?"
- "Where does your sales playbook live right now? Is it one doc or scattered across tools?"
- "When was the last time your playbook was updated?"
- "How do you know if your reps are actually following the playbook?"

**Understanding the impact:**
- "What happens when a rep goes off-script? How often does that happen?"
- "How long does it take a new rep to hit quota today?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your sales team's execution, what would it be?"

## Stakeholder Mapping Questions

- "Besides yourself, who else cares about how the sales team is ramping and executing?"
- "Who would need to sign off on a purchase like this?"
- "Is there a Rev Ops or enablement team involved in evaluating tools?"
- "How have you made similar decisions in the past? What was the process?"

## Discovery-to-Value Connection

Map what you learn in discovery to the value you present in the demo:

| They say... | You show... |
|------------|------------|
| "Our playbook is a 90-page PDF" | Import their PDF and show it analyzed in minutes |
| "New reps take 6 months to ramp" | Skill gap analysis showing exactly where to focus |
| "We don't know if reps follow the process" | Health score and coverage metrics |
| "Content is spread across Notion and Confluence" | Multi-source import bringing everything together |
| "Our messaging is inconsistent" | Messaging section with clear talk tracks |

## True Requirements Probing

- "You mentioned you need [X]. Help me understand — what happens if you don't have that?"
- "If [X feature] wasn't available, would that be a deal-breaker or just a preference?"
- "What's the minimum you need to see in a tool to feel confident moving forward?"
- "Which of these capabilities would have the biggest impact on your team tomorrow?"

## Decision Process Uncovering

- "What does your evaluation process typically look like for a tool like this?"
- "Are there other solutions you're comparing us against?"
- "What's your ideal timeline for having something in place?"
- "Is there a budget allocated for this, or would we need to make the case for it?"
- "Who else would need to see a demo before you could move forward?"

---

# Demo & Solution Fit

## Demo Storyline & Sequence

**The golden rule:** Never demo features. Demo outcomes.

**Standard demo flow (25 minutes):**

1. **Set the stage (3 min):** "Based on what you told me, your biggest challenge is [X]. Let me show you how we'd solve that."

2. **Import their world (5 min):** Show importing from whatever source they use (Notion, Confluence, or PDF). Use their actual content if possible, or a similar example.

3. **Show the analysis (7 min):** Walk through the skill mapping and health score. Highlight gaps that match their stated pain points.

4. **Demonstrate improvement (5 min):** Show how they'd fill a gap — edit a section, get AI suggestions, see the health score improve.

5. **Connect to outcomes (5 min):** "Imagine every new rep started day one with this. Instead of 6 months to ramp, you're looking at 2-3 months."

## Customer-Specific Demo Examples

**For a company with a PDF playbook:**
"I see you have a comprehensive PDF. Let me show you what happens when we import it..." → Import their actual PDF, show the analysis, highlight that 30% of skills might be missing.

**For a company using Notion:**
"You've got great content in Notion. Let me connect to a similar workspace and show you how it all comes together..." → Show Notion import flow, emphasize that scattered pages become one structured playbook.

**For a company with no playbook:**
"Starting from scratch is actually an advantage — you get to build it right from day one. Let me show you our template..." → Use the Taskbase template playbook, show how comprehensive it is out of the box.

## Solution Fit Assessment

Before the demo, rate solution fit on these dimensions:

| Dimension | Good fit | Stretch | Poor fit |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|
| Content source | Uses Notion, Confluence, or has PDFs | Uses a tool we don't integrate with yet | No existing content and no willingness to create |
| Team size | 5-100 reps | 100-500 reps (need enterprise features) | <5 reps (ROI hard to justify) |
| Process maturity | Has defined stages and some playbook content | Has a process but it's informal | No process at all |
| Tech savviness | Comfortable with SaaS tools | Needs hand-holding | Resistant to new tools |

## Persona-Based Demo Adaptation

**For VP of Sales:** Focus on health score, skill gaps across the team, and ramp time impact. Skip technical details.

**For Sales Enablement:** Focus on content management, import flow, editing experience. Show how easy it is to update and maintain.

**For Rev Ops:** Focus on integrations, data and metrics, process adherence tracking. Show the analytical side.

**For a mixed audience:** Lead with the business outcome (VP), show the product (Enablement), address technical questions (Rev Ops).

## Risk Areas & Humility

**Be honest about what we don't do (yet):**
- "We're not a replacement for your CRM — we complement it"
- "Our analytics are focused on playbook coverage, not individual rep performance tracking"
- "We don't do live call coaching — we help with the preparation and knowledge side"

**When they ask about something we can't do:**
"That's not something we support today. What I'd recommend is [alternative approach]. Would that work for your situation?"

Never overpromise. It's better to lose a deal honestly than win one that churns.

---

# Objection & Pricing Handling

## Context-Aware Objection Handling

### "We already have a playbook"
**Context:** They have content but it's not working.
**Response:** "That's actually ideal — we're not asking you to start over. We take what you have and make it actionable. Most teams we work with have a playbook; the challenge is that nobody uses it. Can I ask: when was the last time a rep actually opened your playbook?"

### "We don't have budget for this"
**Context:** Budget isn't allocated yet.
**Response:** "Understood — budget is always a consideration. Let me ask this: what's the cost of one rep taking 6 months to ramp instead of 3? For most teams our size, that's $50-100K in lost productivity. We can help you build the business case if that would be useful."

### "We're evaluating other solutions"
**Context:** Competitive situation.
**Response:** "Smart to look at options. What criteria are you evaluating against? I want to make sure we're addressing what matters most to you. What I hear from teams that chose us is that our approach of starting with their existing content — rather than making them build from scratch — is what set us apart."

### "We can build this internally"
**Context:** DIY consideration.
**Response:** "You absolutely could. The question is whether that's the best use of your team's time. Most teams we talk to tried the internal route first — a Google Doc here, a Notion page there — and found that maintaining it became a full-time job. How much time is your enablement team spending on playbook maintenance today?"

### "This seems too simple / not enterprise enough"
**Context:** Enterprise buyer wants complexity.
**Response:** "Simplicity is actually intentional. The #1 reason playbook tools fail is because they're too complex for reps to use daily. We focus on making something your team will actually open every day. That said, let me show you the analytics and customization options — there's depth beneath the simplicity."

## Persona-Specific Objection Patterns

**VP of Sales objections tend to be about:** ROI, time to value, will reps actually use it.
→ Respond with metrics, customer stories, and adoption data.

**Enablement objections tend to be about:** Ease of content management, migration effort, feature gaps.
→ Respond with product demos, import flow, and roadmap.

**Rev Ops objections tend to be about:** Integrations, data security, technical requirements.
→ Respond with documentation, architecture overview, and reference calls.

## Pricing Question Guidelines

**When they ask "How much does it cost?" early:**
"Pricing depends on team size and needs. Before I give you a number, I want to make sure we're solving the right problem — that way I can recommend the right package. Can I ask a few more questions first?"

**When presenting pricing:**
- Always present pricing in context of value, not in isolation
- Show the cost per rep per month (makes it feel small)
- Compare to the cost of the problem (slow ramp, lost deals)
- Offer annual pricing with a discount

**Discount guidelines:**
- Never discount more than 15% without manager approval
- Prefer adding value (extended trial, extra onboarding support) over cutting price
- Annual commitment = standard discount (10-15% over monthly)
- Multi-year deals can go up to 20% with VP approval

## Top Rep Response Examples

**When a deal is stalling:**
Top rep: "Hey [Name], I want to be upfront — I noticed we've pushed this meeting twice. I totally understand if priorities have shifted. Can you help me understand where this stands on your end? If the timing isn't right, that's okay — I'd rather know so I can be helpful when it is."

**When asked for a deep discount:**
Top rep: "I hear you on budget constraints. Here's what I can do: if we go with an annual commitment, I can offer [X]% off. But more importantly, let me show you the ROI model — most teams see payback within 60 days based on ramp time reduction alone."

## Trust Preservation Do's & Don'ts

**Do:**
- Admit when you don't know something: "Great question — let me check and get back to you by tomorrow"
- Acknowledge their concerns genuinely before responding
- Share both pros and cons of your approach
- Reference specific customer examples (with permission)
- Follow through on every promise, no matter how small

**Don't:**
- Trash talk competitors
- Make promises about future features without confirming with product
- Pressure a prospect into a decision they're not ready for
- Ignore concerns or try to "handle" them away
- Use high-pressure closing tactics

# Tools, Tech Stack & Usage

## CRM Usage Rules & Fields

**Required fields for every opportunity:**

| Field | When to update | Format |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| Stage | After every meeting | Use standard stage names |
| Next Step | After every interaction | Specific action + date |
| Close Date | Discovery onwards | Best estimate, update weekly |
| Amount | After pricing discussion | Annual contract value |
| Champion | Once identified | Contact name |
| Competition | When discovered | Competitor name(s) |
| Notes | After every meeting | Key takeaways, not transcripts |

**CRM hygiene rules:**
- Update opportunity stage within 24 hours of stage change
- Every opportunity must have a next step with a date
- Add meeting notes the same day
- Flag at-risk deals immediately, don't wait for pipeline review

## Sales Engagement Tools

| Tool | Purpose | When to use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| CRM (Salesforce/HubSpot) | Pipeline management | Every deal, every day |
| Email sequencing tool | Outbound prospecting | Prospecting stage |
| Calendar/scheduling tool | Meeting booking | All stages |
| Video conferencing | Virtual meetings | Discovery, demo, proposal |
| Document sharing | Proposals, case studies | Demo onwards |
| Sales intelligence | Research & signals | Pre-call research |

## Handover Processes

**SDR to AE handover:**
1. SDR books the meeting and sends intro email (cc AE)
2. SDR fills out handover note: company context, pain points mentioned, contact details
3. AE reviews handover before the meeting
4. AE sends a follow-up to the SDR after discovery: qualified or not, and why

**AE to CS handover (post-close):**
1. AE fills out customer handover doc: why they bought, key stakeholders, success criteria, potential risks
2. AE introduces CS manager via email before contract starts
3. AE joins the first onboarding call
4. CS owns the relationship from onboarding day 1

## Meeting Notes Standards

**Every meeting note should include:**
1. **Attendees** — Who was there, their roles
2. **Key takeaways** — 3-5 bullet points on what you learned
3. **Objections raised** — What concerns came up
4. **Next steps** — Specific actions with owners and dates
5. **Deal health update** — Any change to risk level or timeline

**Template:**
"Date: [Date] | Attendees: [Names & roles]
Takeaways: [bullets]
Objections: [bullets]
Next steps: [who does what by when]
Deal health: [green/yellow/red + reason]"

## Forecasting Expectations

**Commit categories:**
- **Commit:** 90%+ probability. Contract sent, verbal agreement, just waiting on signatures.
- **Best case:** 60-80% probability. Demo done, proposal being reviewed, no blockers identified.
- **Pipeline:** 30-50% probability. Discovery done, solution fit confirmed, but not all decision makers engaged.
- **Upside:** <30% probability. Early stage, still qualifying.

**Rules:**
- Only forecast deals you've had a conversation about in the last 14 days
- If you haven't talked to the prospect in 2 weeks, move it to upside
- Close dates must be based on the prospect's timeline, not yours
- Update your forecast every Friday before end of day

# Opportunity Management & Deal Control

## Mutual Commitment Checklists

**Before requesting a proposal meeting:**
- [ ] Discovery completed with identified pain
- [ ] At least 2 stakeholders engaged
- [ ] Economic buyer identified by name
- [ ] Budget range discussed
- [ ] Decision timeline confirmed
- [ ] No unresolved blocking objections

**Before sending a contract:**
- [ ] Pricing and terms verbally agreed
- [ ] All decision makers have seen the demo
- [ ] Legal/procurement requirements identified
- [ ] Implementation timeline discussed
- [ ] Success criteria defined

## Next-Step Control Techniques

**The "specific ask" approach:**
Instead of: "Let's reconnect next week"
Say: "I'd love to schedule a 30-minute demo for you and [other stakeholder] next Tuesday or Wednesday. Does 2pm work?"

**The "mutual agenda" approach:**
"For our next meeting, I think it would be valuable to [specific agenda item]. Would it make sense to include [other stakeholder] since they'd need to weigh in on [specific topic]?"

**The "pre-commitment" approach:**
"If the demo goes well and you see the value, what would the next step be on your end? I want to make sure we're aligned on the process."

## Internal Alignment Playbook

**When to involve your manager:**
- Deal is > $50K ACV
- Enterprise prospect with complex buying committee
- Prospect asks for non-standard terms
- Deal has been stuck for > 2 weeks
- You need executive alignment (your VP to their VP)

**How to ask for help:**
Come with context, not just a request. Share: deal background, where it's stuck, what you've tried, and what you think would help.

## Opportunity Prioritization

**Focus your time based on this matrix:**

| | High ICP fit | Low ICP fit |
|---|---|---|
| **Strong engagement** | Top priority — invest heavily | Qualify harder — might not be a fit |
| **Low engagement** | Re-engage — they should be a fit | Deprioritize — move to nurture |

**Weekly priority check:**
1. Which deals have a next step this week?
2. Which deals are at risk of stalling?
3. Which new opportunities need qualification?
4. Which deals should I deprioritize or close-lost?

## Decision Process Understanding

**Map the buying process early:**

Questions to ask:
- "Have you bought a tool like this before? What was the process?"
- "Who needs to approve a purchase in this price range?"
- "Is there a procurement or legal review involved?"
- "What's your typical timeline from 'yes we want this' to signed contract?"

**Common buying processes:**

| Company size | Typical process | Timeline |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| < 100 employees | VP decides, maybe one other person | 2-4 weeks |
| 100-500 employees | Committee of 3-5, possibly procurement | 4-8 weeks |
| 500+ employees | Formal procurement, security review, legal | 8-16 weeks |

**Pro tip:** Ask about the process in meeting 1. Don't wait until you're trying to close.
